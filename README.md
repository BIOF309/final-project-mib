_**Purpose of this project:**_ Our lab studies neuroinflammation and depression using PET neuroimaging.
Our research has shown that there is a relationship between neuroinflammation and depression however, for this project we wanted to
see if there was a correlation between depression and obesity.

Studies have shown that certain parts of the brain, such as the hypothalamus, hippocampus, cortex, brainstem, and amygdala, are affected by obesity-derived neuroinflammation

The following project presents four graphs of **obesity and mental health** prevalence in the United States.
We have compared gender and age group across the US in an attempt to better understand the link between the two diseases.

**Why studying obesity and depression is important**
- Need for better understanding of links
- Obesity is the second leading cause of death


**Coding Process**
- Tried to create the best graphs for the data presented
- Limits


**GRAPHS**

##### Figure 1 shows obesity and depression rates over time for adults.

##### Figure 2 shows the prevalence of any mental health disorder in 2016 by gender and various age groups

#### Figure 3 shows the prevalence of people with both obesity and depression by age group and gender
